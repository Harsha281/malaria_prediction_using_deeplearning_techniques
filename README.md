# malaria_prediction_using_deeplearning_techniques
This is a sofware developed by using python and deeplearning techniques cnn ,vgg and resnet .This model uses blood smear images for dectection these images are spllited and preprocesses and trained using these techniques to give resultant output
The dataset is taken from the NIH(National Institute Of Health).Firstly the data is splitted and the data is preproceesesd and the data obtained after preprocess is trained using CNN(Convolution Neural Network).In this we add 3 layers of convolution layers to ontain the maximun accuracy.
After we created another model using VGG(Visual Geometry Group) and Resnet(Residual Network) we measued the accuracy.The accuracy obtained by this deepcnn tecniques is less than normal cnn(which consists of 3 layers).
The cnn model gave us appoximatel 97 percent accuracy.
whereas the deepcnn techniques vgg and resnet gave 60 and 76 percent accuracy.which comparively very less and not suiltable for malraia prediction.
so we concluded that cnn is best and feasible for malaria prediction.
